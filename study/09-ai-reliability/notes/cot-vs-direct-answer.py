"""
Prototype: Chain-of-Thought vs. Direct Answer
==============================================
Demonstrates that asking a model to "think step by step" is a reliability
lever - not just a stylistic choice.

For each multi-step reasoning problem we run two prompt strategies N times:
  - Direct  - "Answer in one short sentence. Do not show working."
  - CoT     - "Think step by step, then state your final answer."

We score every response, aggregate accuracy across all runs, and display
a side-by-side comparison so the *distribution* - not just a single lucky
or unlucky example - is visible.

Concept: CoT forces the model to commit to intermediate steps, which
catches compounding errors before they reach the final answer.

IMPORTANT: use a NON-reasoning model (e.g. gpt-4o-mini). Reasoning models
think internally even when told not to show working, which erases the gap
this prototype exists to measure.
