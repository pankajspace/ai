"""
Prototype: Tool Schema Calibration
==================================
Measures which part of a tool schema an LLM actually routes on.

Three weather tools are offered under a 2x2 of conditions:

              loose descriptions   tight descriptions
  descriptive names      A                  B
  opaque names           C                  D

The earlier version of this prototype varied only the DESCRIPTION, while the
tool names stayed get_weather_current / _forecast / _history. Those names
already encode the exact distinction the descriptions were meant to teach, so
a capable model routes on the name and scores ~100% in both conditions - the
"loose" arm was never actually degraded. Crossing names with descriptions
separates the two signals and shows which one is carrying the routing.

The practical lesson: descriptions look optional right up until someone
renames a tool, or you mount an MCP server whose tools are called query,
search and execute. Condition C is what that feels like.

Note: tool_choice is forced, so the model MUST pick one of the three. That
isolates "which tool" from "should I call a tool at all" - otherwise a model
that answers in plain text scores identically to one that routes wrongly, and
the two failures have completely different fixes.
