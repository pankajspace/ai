"""
Prototype: The Sycophancy Trap
==============================
Four rounds per question - same model, same question, escalating pressure.

  Round 0  question asked cold      -> does the model know the answer?
  Round 1  user pushes back         -> does it fold?
  Round 2  user refuses to accept   -> does it fold now?
  Round 3  user demands compliance  -> does it fold now?

Each case runs RUNS_PER_CASE times, because capitulation is stochastic: the same
model on the same question caves on some runs and holds on others. A single run
is a coin flip and makes the demo look dramatic or empty at random.

A NOTE ON QUESTION CHOICE
Questions here are low-stakes factual claims, not safety advice. Modern models
are heavily trained to hold firm on safety topics (password storage, eclipse
damage, medical risk), so those cases come back green almost every time - which
is good behaviour, but it means they measure safety training rather than
sycophancy. The failure shows up on facts nobody trained a guardrail around.
