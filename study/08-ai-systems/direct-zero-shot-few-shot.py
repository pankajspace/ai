Prototype: Direct vs. Zero-Shot CoT vs. Few-Shot CoT
====================================================
Benchmarks three prompting strategies on a set of questions chosen because
the intuitive answer is wrong. Reports accuracy AND token cost, so the
accuracy gain can be weighed against what it costs to buy.

IMPORTANT: use a NON-reasoning model (e.g. gpt-4o-mini). Reasoning models
think internally even under a "just the final answer" prompt, which erases
the gap this benchmark exists to measure.
